This repository includes my notes for the free online e-book, Learn You a Haskell for Great Good, written by Miran Lipovaƒça. The book written in the form of a tutorial is available on this [link](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

The Haskell code and problems from the book can be tried on an Online [REPL](https://tryhaskell.org/) or a local Haskell installation (stack recommended).

## Useful commands

You can start an interpreter using the command `stack ghci` 

To load a Haskell script into the interpreter, use the command `:l <script-name.hs>`

To check the type of an expression, use `:t`, for eg., `:t "Pritesh"` should return `[Char]`
